# GroceryShopping
A grocery shopping sample app written with XCode 9 and SWIFT 4.

Let's write some User Stories for our little app (no acceptance criteria for now):
* ~~As a User I want to see all items available so that I know what I can shop.~~
* ~~As a User I want to add items to my shopping cart so I can select the items I want.~~
* ~~As a User I want to be able to see the current costs of my shoppings in order to know what I will have to pay in US Dollars.~~
* As a User I want to see what my shoppings costs are in other currencies so that I can pay with a different currency.
