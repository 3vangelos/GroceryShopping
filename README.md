* ~~As a User I want to add items to my shopping cart so I can select the items I want.~~
* ~~As a User I want to be able to see the current costs of my shoppings in order to know what I will have to pay in US Dollars.~~
* ~~As a User I want to see what my shoppings costs are in other currencies so that I can pay with a different currency.~~
